## Introduction

This project explores and analyzes customer churn data to uncover underlying patterns and factors that lead to customer attrition. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as it significantly impacts profitability. Research shows that acquiring a new customer can be anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one (Gallo, 2014). Furthermore, a study by Frederick Reichheld of Bain & Company reveals that increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%, underscoring the substantial impact of effective retention strategies (Gallo, 2014).

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to:

- **Identify Key Factors**: Determine the demographic and service-related factors that significantly impact customer churn.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employ logistic regression and random forests to forecast potential churn effectively, enabling proactive retention strategies.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provide actionable insights that businesses can use to enhance customer engagement and reduce churn rates.

These objectives aim to equip businesses with better tools to improve their customer retention strategies, thereby enhancing their overall profitability.
